lti_tool_provider_rails_example
===============================

A basic Rails app to build your LTI apps 

Work in progress...

## LTI Parameters

Parameters that should always be here:
 
*  LTI message type, should always equal:  basic-lti-launch-request
*  LTI Version, for now, should be: lti_version: LTI-1.0
*  Resource link id: uniq for each spot where the app is used in a course/plateform. Example: resource_link_id: a2b86a2534
*  Context Id: uniq id for the course/group/other setting. Example: context_id: a8973674c7
*  User Id: uniq id for the user across a platform. Example: user_id: fb7e22d87d
*  Roles: Store the roles of users in specific short or long formats: http://www.imsglobal.org/lti/blti/bltiv1p0/ltiBLTIimgv1p0.html#_Toc261271984 
*  OAuth Consumer Key: uniq key that should be sent back to the app along with a shared secret. oauth_consumer_key: 2f8f0761267181a085502a6b62256de1
*  oauth_nonce: random string generated by the platform to improve security. One oauth_nonce should not be used within the next 90 minutes of its first use
    - thus they should be stored for comparisons/historics. Example: oauth_nonce: NszcH4JPm5HCtzB2UcyDKggHzrny9iyaEOikkIP8UI
*  oauth_timestamp: Timestamp to prevent replay attacks. It should not be too old and thus we have to check it is quite "recent". 
    Example: oauth_timestamp: '1404812533'
*  oauth_signature: generated based on all others parameters. It should be checked for security reasons. Example: oauth_signature: kXplraBcOlciwjohNsKzkZFr9Js=
*  lis_person_name_full, lis_person_contact_email_primary, lis_person_name_given, and lis_person_name_family: 
    Parameters to identify user
*  Custom Params: custom parameters that may be sent to give more information (or used at app config time to send them in each request)
    Example: custom_bacon: '4010591865'
*  Outcome Service Url: tells us if we can post grades to the gradebook or not. If it's there, we can, if not, we can't.
